# To Do

1. Modularize all src/js files so they can be `require()`d and bundled with browserify
2. perhaps consolidate getFolders() and transferFolder() into a single function?
    1. If not, be sure to add each folder as its being transferred into statusTable
3. build StatusTable and append
4. Style modal popup with bootstrap
